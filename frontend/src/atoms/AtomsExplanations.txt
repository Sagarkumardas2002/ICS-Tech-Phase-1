What is an Atom in React (Recoil)?
  In Recoil, an atom is a piece of state that can be shared across multiple components.
  Think of it as a central data store for a specific value.
  Any component that reads from it will re-render automatically when its value changes.
  It’s like useState but global instead of local to one component.



**************************File 1 — authScreenAtom.js*************************************
//Imports the atom function from Recoil so we can create a new piece of global state
import { atom } from "recoil";


//atom({...}) → Creates a new atom.
//key: 'authScreenAtom' → A unique ID for this atom (must be unique in your whole app).
//default: 'login' → Initial value for the atom (by default, the auth screen will show 'login').

  const authScreenAtom = atom({
      key: 'authScreenAtom',
      default: 'login',
  })

export default authScreenAtom;  //Exports this atom so other files can import and use it.






**************************File 2 — messagesAtoms.js*************************************
//Creates and exports an atom for all conversations.
//key is "conversationsAtom" (unique identifier).
//default is an empty array (no conversations initially).

    export const conversationsAtom = atom({
      key: "conversationsAtom",
      default: [],
    });


//Creates and exports another atom for the currently selected conversation.
//Default value is an empty conversation object with keys _id, userId, username, and userProfilePic.
      
  export const selectedConversationAtom = atom({
        key: "selectedConversationAtom",
        default: {
          _id: "",
          userId: "",
          username: "",
          userProfilePic: "",
        },
      });






**************************File 3 — postsAtom.js*************************************
//Creates an atom to store posts data.
//key is "postsAtom", default is [] (empty array — no posts initially).
    
    import { atom } from "recoil"
    const postsAtom = atom({
        key: "postsAtom",
        default: [],
    });
    export default postsAtom;  //Without exporting it, that atom would be stuck in its file and nobody else could access it.






**************************File 4 — userAtom.js*************************************
//Creates an atom for user data.
//key is "username".
//default value is fetched from localStorage:
//localStorage.getItem('user-threads') → Gets stored user data (string).
//JSON.parse(...) → Converts that string into a JS object.
//If nothing is in localStorage, default will be null.

    import { atom } from "recoil";
    const userAtom = atom({
        key: 'username',
        default: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user-threads'))
    })
