What is an Atom in React (Recoil)?
  In Recoil, an atom is a piece of state that can be shared across multiple components.
  Think of it as a central data store for a specific value.
  Any component that reads from it will re-render automatically when its value changes.
  Itâ€™s like useState but global instead of local to one component.



//Imports the atom function from Recoil so we can create a new piece of global state
import { atom } from "recoil";

const authScreenAtom = atom({
    key: 'authScreenAtom',
    default: 'login',
})

export default authScreenAtom;
